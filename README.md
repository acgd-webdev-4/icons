# So many icons!

## Overview

- *Continue work on your `ecommerce-pattern-library`*
- Create an Adobe Illustrator document with every icon on a separate artboard.
- Export the icons as SVGs, following our standard export procedure.
- Drop all the icons into Spritebot and save them as a single sprite sheet.
- **Put the sprite sheet in your `images` folder named exactly `icons.svg`—Patternbot will do everything else**.
- *Your logo is not an icon—it’s already done, inside the `logo.svg` files.*
